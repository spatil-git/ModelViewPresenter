#  Model View Presenter 
Simple project demonstrating the usage of the MVP patter.

Model <-> Presenter <-> ViewController

Here, presenter is responsible for converting the data model to be presentable and pass down to the controller. Controller is lightweight as presenter takes care of the data manupulation and also networking and parsing. Contrller just has the UI code to update the UI.

Model is also a seperate class in this pattern.
